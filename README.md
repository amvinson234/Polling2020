# PrimaryPolling-2019


### Description 
This is a small project playing with and analyzing Democratic Primary Polling. The project may be expanded to analyze other polling data, such as general election polls, Congressional polls, etc.

For now, the project consists of a Jupyter notebook, in which I utilize primary polling aggregation from FiveThirtyEight.com for the 2019 primaries to analyze trends for top candidates. 

### Purpose
This is a personal project meant to further familiarize myself with data science tools and packages.
