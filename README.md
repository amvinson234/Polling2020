# Polling 2020

### Description 
This is a small project playing with and analyzing polling for the 2020 presidential election cycle as well as other opinion polling. Currently analyzing presidential approval and democratic primary polling. The project may be expanded to analyze other polling data, such as general election polls, Congressional polls, etc.

Right now, all data utilizes polling aggregations from FiveThirtyEight.com for the 2020 primaries and presidential approval

Everything is currently very much a work-in-progress

### Purpose
This is a personal project meant to further familiarize myself with data science tools and packages.
